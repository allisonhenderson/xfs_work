/*
 * This is the "attr intention" log item.  It is used to log the fact that some
 * attribute operations need to be processed.  An operation is currently either
 * a set or remove.  Set or remove operations are described by the xfs_attr_item
 * which may be logged to this intent.  Intents are used in conjunction with the
 * "attr done" log item described below.
 *
 * The ATTRI is reference counted so that it is not freed prior to both the
 * ATTRI and ATTRD being committed and unpinned. This ensures the ATTRI is
 * inserted into the AIL even in the event of out of order ATTRI/ATTRD
 * processing. In other words, an ATTRI is born with two references:
 *
 *      1.) an ATTRI held reference to track ATTRI AIL insertion
 *      2.) an ATTRD held reference to track ATTRD commit
 *
 * On allocation, both references are the responsibility of the caller. Once the
 * ATTRI is added to and dirtied in a transaction, ownership of reference one
 * transfers to the transaction. The reference is dropped once the ATTRI is
 * inserted to the AIL or in the event of failure along the way (e.g., commit
 * failure, log I/O error, etc.). Note that the caller remains responsible for
 * the ATTRD reference under all circumstances to this point. The caller has no
 * means to detect failure once the transaction is committed, however.
 * Therefore, an ATTRD is required after this point, even in the event of
 * unrelated failure.
 *
 * Once an ATTRD is allocated and dirtied in a transaction, reference two
 * transfers to the transaction. The ATTRD reference is dropped once it reaches
 * the unpin handler. Similar to the ATTRI, the reference also drops in the
 * event of commit failure or log I/O errors. Note that the ATTRD is not
 * inserted in the AIL, so at this point both the ATTRI and ATTRD are freed.
